# citeroPushToPlugin
The Citero push to plugin uses the Citero web service API to route all of Primo's records to an external API endpoint. The Citero web service then resolves the action for the end user. This allows us to maintain only one application for Citation management, and guarantees all of our citations are resolved in the same way.
